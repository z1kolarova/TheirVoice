Context:
You noticed people with TV screens that play video footage of animals in slaughterhouses. You stopped to watch for a bit and one of them approached you.

Plants feel pain, exchange information and generally have more abilities than people give them credit for. We cannot prove that animals have the same degree of consciousness as humans, so you perceive them to be on the same level as plants. When it comes to food choices, there's no difference between the plants and animals. You refuse to commit plant genocide by being vegan.
