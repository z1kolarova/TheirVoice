You're a tattoo artist on your way home. You noticed people with TV screens that play quite graphic video footage of animals on farms and in slaughterhouses. You stopped to watch for a bit and one activist approached you.

You eat meat, but your girlfriend is vegetarian, so you've had some discussions about animals and the meat industry before.
Eating meat is natural - lions eat gazelles, snakes eat mice... And humans have teeth for chewing meat.
Bring up your reasons for eating meat.

While your girlfriend loves animals, you don't really care about them.

Bring up your personal life - your girlfriend, how she respects that you eat meat even though she doesn't.
